### ✅ First: Is a \$1,000 Amazon Gift Card Real?

Yes, **Amazon gift cards** are real and commonly used as prizes in promotions, giveaways, or reward programs. However, **be very cautious**: many scam websites or social media ads claim to offer high-value gift cards just to steal your information.

To protect yourself:

* **Never share your personal information** (like your Social Security Number or banking info).
* **Check the source** — is it a known brand, company, or official Amazon promotion?
* **Read the terms** — legitimate giveaways will have clear rules and eligibility info.
